# Pre-requisites

If you are totally new to Linux, we will encourage you to enrol in the free introductory course by The Linux Foundation:  [LFS101x Introduction to Linux](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/training/introduction-to-linux/) on edX.  

We will primarily be using the command line interface to perform our tasks and will only be briefing going through the following:

* Linux Installation
* Getting Help
* Text Editors

Do refer to the LFS101x course if you need more details on the above topics.
